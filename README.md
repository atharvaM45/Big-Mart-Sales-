# Big-Mart-Sales-
This project predicts the chances of the product in the market. Various Machine Learning Algorithms are used in the Project. 
Currently, supermarket run-centres, Big Marts keep track of each individual item's sales data in order to anticipate potential consumer demand and update inventory management. Anomalies and general trends are often discovered by mining the data warehouse's data store. For retailers like Big Mart, the resulting data can be used to forecast future sales volume using various machine learning techniques like big mart. A predictive model was developed using Xgboost, Linear regression, Polynomial regression, and Ridge regression techniques for forecasting the sales of a business such as Big-Mart, and it was discovered that the model outperforms existing models.
